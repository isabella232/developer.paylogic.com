Berco is CTO of Paylogic. Besides being CTO and running a high-tech company
he loves everything related to software engineering. Whether it's diving
into the architecture of proper REST API's or advances in programming
languages, Berco is always getting his hands dirty. With a background in 
distributed systems he has a particular interest in big, distributed, 
fault-tolerant systems. After spending too much time with Prolog and Java
Berco is happy to say most of his current coding is in Python.
