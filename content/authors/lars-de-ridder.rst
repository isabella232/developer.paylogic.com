Lars is the team lead of Engineering at Paylogic. He is happy working on
anything related to software engineering, be it coding or requirements
engineering and project management, and as such can find his place in any team.
His specialty is to turn vague ideas and dreams into concrete and real systems
and solutions. He however dislikes people who write about themselves in the
third person.
